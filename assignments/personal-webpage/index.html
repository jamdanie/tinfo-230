    <p>Welcome to my personal homepage! This is a simple space where I’m practicing web design and sharing a little about who I am and what I’m working on. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a full-time student focused on technology and problem-solving. I enjoy learning step-by-step and turning ideas into projects.</p>

    <h2>What I’m Working On</h2>
    <p>Right now I’m practicing HTML and CSS, building small class projects, and improving my technical skills one assignment at a time.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I enjoy tech, design, and anything that blends creativity with systems thinking. I also like working on structured study plans and hands-on learning.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you’d like to reach me later, I’ll add contact details here once I learn forms and links.</p>
